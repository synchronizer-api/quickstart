# DearDoc × Synchronizer
How DearDoc automated patient scheduling and freed two full-time engineers using the Synchronizer API.
  
## About DearDoc

[DearDoc](https://getdeardoc.com) builds growth tools for private practices — AI chat, review management, and high-conversion websites.  Their AI chat product drives thousands of high-intent patient leads every month.

The challenge? Those leads still required **manual entry** into each practice’s **Practice Management System (PMS)**,  Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental, and others, creating bottlenecks and wasted time.

## The Challenge

Integrating with multiple PMS systems means dealing with:

- Different authentication patterns  
- Inconsistent field naming  
- Complex data dependencies  
- Rate-limit quirks and version drift  

DearDoc’s engineers were spending valuable cycles maintaining one-off connections — instead of shipping new features.

They needed a **reliable, two-way sync** (read/write) to move booked appointments directly from their AI chat into each PMS.

## The Solution

DearDoc implemented **[Synchronizer](https://synchronizer.io)** — an API integration layer purpose-built for healthcare.  
Synchronizer handles normalization, sync reliability, and PMS-specific logic out of the box.

That allowed DearDoc to:

- Offload integration maintenance  
- Focus on product and customer experience  
- Scale appointment automation across PMS systems  

> “The Synchronizer API made it easy to read from and write into PMS data. It just works.”

## The Results

According to the [official case study](https://content.synchronizer.io/case-studies/deardoc):

| Metric | Result |
|--------|---------|
| Engineering time saved | 2 full-time engineers freed |
| Appointment sync | 100% automation from AI chat → PMS |
| Reliability | 99.9% uptime |
| Developer experience | Fast onboarding, solid support |

## Takeaways

- **Don’t rebuild what’s already solved.** Healthcare integrations are a time sink.  
- **Two-way sync > one-way polling.** Real automation requires writing data back.  
- **Reliability scales trust.** 99.9% uptime keeps front-office teams happy and focused.
